#' Dataset: CD8+T cell gene expression data
#' @description
#' The CD8T dataset provides the gene expression data of fetal CD8+T cells
#' obtained in single-cell RNA sequencing experiment. 
#' @usage CD8T
#' @format Data are provided in
#' raw sequencing counts as a data frame with 9369 rows (cells) and 1000 
#' columns (genes). 
#' @source The original data were part of the published data by Suo and 
#' colleagues in Science (2022). Here we use only cells that were annotated 
#' to be CD8+T and the top 1000 highly variable genes.
